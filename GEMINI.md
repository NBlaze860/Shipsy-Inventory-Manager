Add Pagination to Products Page

## Context
You are working on a React application with Redux state management. The Products page currently displays all products in a grid layout using Tailwind CSS. The application uses a clean, professional design with gray/indigo color scheme.

## Current Structure
- **Products.jsx**: Main page component that fetches and displays products
- **ProductList.jsx**: Component that renders products in a grid layout (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`)
- **ProductCard.jsx**: Individual product card component with white background and rounded corners
- **Redux Store**: Uses `productsSlice.js` for state management

## Task
Add pagination functionality to display only 9 products per page with a pagination bar positioned just below the product cards.

## Requirements

### Pagination Logic
- Display exactly 9 products per page
- Calculate total pages based on product count
- Track current page in component state
- Slice the products array based on current page

### UI Design
- Position pagination bar directly below the product grid
- Match the existing design system (Tailwind CSS, gray/indigo theme)
- Use clean, minimal pagination controls
- Include: Previous button, page numbers, Next button
- Disable Previous/Next buttons when appropriate
- Highlight current page number

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Keep code minimal and clean** - Only add necessary functionality
2. **Maintain existing structure** - Don't modify ProductCard or ProductList components unnecessarily
3. **Use React hooks** - useState for pagination state
4. **Professional styling** - Match the existing button styles and color scheme
5. **Responsive design** - Ensure pagination works on mobile devices

### Specific Styling Requirements
- Use similar button styling as existing "Add Product" and "Logout" buttons
- Current page should be highlighted with indigo background
- Inactive buttons should be grayed out
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Use hover effects for interactive elements

### Code Organization
- Add pagination logic to Products.jsx component
- Create a simple, reusable pagination component if needed
- Keep the implementation straightforward and maintainable

## Expected Output
Modify the existing files to add pagination functionality while maintaining the current design aesthetic and code quality standards. The pagination should feel like a natural part of the existing interface.

## Files to Modify
- `frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx` - Add pagination state and logic
- Optionally create `frontend/src/components/common/Pagination.jsx` if you

##### UI Integration (Products Page)
- On dashboard load => dispatch "Get All Products" and display the products
- On form submit => dispatch "Create Product"
- On edit => dispatch "Update Product"
- On delete => dispatch "Delete Product"
- Ensure proper error handling and success notifications in the UI.
