Context
You are working on a React application with Redux state management. The Products page currently displays products in a grid layout with pagination (9 products per page). The application uses a clean, professional design with gray/indigo color scheme and Tailwind CSS.

Current Structure
Products.jsx: Main page component with pagination functionality
ProductList.jsx: Renders products in grid layout (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
ProductCard.jsx: Individual cards showing product details including category, quantity, unitPrice, and calculated totalValue
Products have categories: 'electronics', 'clothing', 'food', 'books', 'other'
Task
Add 3 filter controls positioned between the page header (with "Add Product" and "Logout" buttons) and the product cards grid.

Filter Requirements
1. Category Filter (Dropdown)
Options: 'All', 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Food', 'Books', 'Other'
Default: 'All' (shows all products)
Filter products by their category property
2. Minimum Total Value Filter (Number Input)
Label: "Min Total Value ($)"
Input type: number with step="0.01"
Filter products where (quantity × unitPrice) >= minValue
Default: empty (no minimum filter)
3. Maximum Total Value Filter (Number Input)
Label: "Max Total Value ($)"
Input type: number with step="0.01"
Filter products where (quantity × unitPrice) <= maxValue
Default: empty (no maximum filter)
Implementation Guidelines
Filter Logic
Use simple JavaScript filter() method on the products array
Apply all active filters simultaneously
Calculate totalValue as quantity * unitPrice for comparison
Reset pagination to page 1 when filters change
Handle empty/undefined filter values gracefully
UI Design & Layout
Position filters in a horizontal row between header and cards
Use consistent spacing and alignment
Match existing form styling (similar to ProductModal inputs)
Responsive design: stack filters vertically on mobile
Use flexbox for layout with proper gaps
Styling Requirements
Match existing input field styling from the application
Use consistent border, padding, and focus states
Label styling should match existing form labels
Maintain the gray/indigo color scheme
Add subtle background or border to separate filter section
State Management
Add filter state to Products.jsx component using useState
Create filter state object: { category: 'all', minValue: '', maxValue: '' }
Create filtered products array before applying pagination
Use useMemo or simple filtering in render for performance
Code Organization
Keep filtering logic in Products.jsx component
Create simple filter functions (can be inline or extracted)
Maintain clean, readable code structure
Use descriptive variable names
Add proper event handlers for each filter
Expected Behavior
Category Filter: Immediately filter products by selected category
Value Filters: Filter products by total value range as user types
Combined Filters: All filters work together (AND logic)
Pagination Reset: Return to page 1 when any filter changes
Clear Indication: Show filtered results count or "No products found" message
Styling Example Structure
// Filter section layout
<div className="mb-6 bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
  <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 items-end">
    {/* Category dropdown */}
    {/* Min value input */}
    {/* Max value input */}
  </div>
</div>
Files to Modify
frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx ( and you can create any component to keep the code organized (but dont overdo it) ) - Add filter state, logic, and UI components
Focus on creating a clean, intuitive filtering system that enhances the user experience while maintaining the existing design consistency and code quality standards.
