Add Real-time Search Bar to Product Filters
Context
You are working on a React application with Redux state management. The Products page currently has:

Product grid layout with pagination (9 products per page)
Filter bar with 4 controls: Category dropdown, Min/Max Total Value inputs, Sort by Price dropdown
Clean, professional design with gray/indigo color scheme and Tailwind CSS
Current Filter Bar Structure
The filter bar contains:

Category filter (dropdown)
Minimum Total Value filter (number input)
Maximum Total Value filter (number input)
Sort by Price filter (dropdown)
Task
Add a search input field to the existing filter bar that provides real-time search functionality based on product names. The search should be frontend-only and update results as the user types.

Search Requirements
Search Input Field
Label: "Search Products"
Placeholder: "Search by product name..."
Input type: text
Position: Add as the first element in the filter bar (leftmost position)
Real-time filtering: Update results on every keystroke
Case-insensitive search
Search Functionality
Search through product name property only
Match partial strings (substring matching)
Show results in real-time as user types
Clear search functionality (X button or clear on empty input)
Debounce search input for better performance (optional but recommended)
Implementation Guidelines
Search Logic
Use simple JavaScript filter() method with includes() for substring matching
Convert both search term and product names to lowercase for case-insensitive search
Apply search FIRST in the filtering chain, before other filters
Handle empty/undefined product names gracefully
Trim whitespace from search input
Processing Order (Updated)
Start with all products from Redux store
Apply search filter (by product name) - NEW FIRST STEP
Apply category filter
Apply min/max total value filters
Apply sorting (by unitPrice)
Apply pagination (slice for current page)
UI Design & Layout
Position search input as the first (leftmost) element in filter bar
Make search input slightly wider than other inputs for better UX
Add search icon (üîç) or use Tailwind's search styling
Include clear button (√ó) when search has content
Maintain responsive behavior with existing filters
Ensure proper spacing and alignment
Real-time Updates
Use onChange event handler for immediate updates
Update search state on every keystroke
Consider using useMemo for search filtering performance
Optional: Add debounce (300ms) to reduce excessive filtering on fast typing
Reset pagination to page 1 when search term changes
State Management
Add search term to existing filter state object
Update state structure: { searchTerm: '', category: 'all', minValue: '', maxValue: '', sortBy: 'default' }
Create search handler function
Clear search functionality to reset search term
Maintain existing state management patterns
Code Organization Options
Option 1: Keep in Products.jsx

Add search logic directly to existing filtering flow
Simple and minimal approach
Option 2: Create SearchBar Component

Create frontend/src/components/common/SearchBar.jsx
Reusable component with props for value, onChange, placeholder
Better code organization and reusability
Option 3: Create FilterBar Component

Create frontend/src/components/products/FilterBar.jsx
Move all filter logic into dedicated component
Clean separation of concerns
Expected Behavior
Real-time Search: Results update immediately as user types
Case Insensitive: "PHONE" matches "iPhone" and "phone"
Partial Matching: "app" matches "Apple iPhone" and "Samsung Galaxy"
Combined Filtering: Search works with all existing filters
Empty State: Show appropriate message when no products match search
Clear Search: Easy way to clear search and show all products
Pagination Reset: Return to page 1 when search term changes
Updated Filter Bar Layout
<div className="mb-6 bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
  <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4 items-end">
    {/* Search input - NEW FIRST ELEMENT */}
    {/* Category dropdown */}
    {/* Min value input */}
    {/* Max value input */}
    {/* Sort by price dropdown */}
  </div>
</div>
Search Input Structure Example
<div className="flex-1 min-w-0 sm:max-w-xs">
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1">
    Search Products
  </label>
  <div className="relative">
    <input
      type="text"
      placeholder="Search by product name..."
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={handleSearchChange}
      className="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:border-indigo-500"
    />
    {/* Optional: Clear button when search has content */}
  </div>
</div>
Performance Considerations
Use useMemo for filtered results to avoid unnecessary recalculations
Consider debouncing search input for better performance
Ensure search doesn't block UI on large product lists
Files to Modify/Create
frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx - Add search state and logic
Optional: frontend/src/components/common/SearchBar.jsx - Reusable search component
Optional: frontend/src/components/products/FilterBar.jsx - Dedicated filter component
Focus on creating a smooth, responsive search experience that integrates seamlessly with the existing filter system while maintaining code quality and design consistency.
