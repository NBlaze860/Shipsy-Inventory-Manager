Implement React Router in the frontend.

Install react-router-dom if not already installed.

In the main application entry (e.g., App.jsx), wrap the app in <BrowserRouter>.

Create routes for:

/register → Register.jsx page

/login → Login.jsx page

Ensure navigation links between pages work correctly (e.g., “Already have an account? Login” and “Don’t have an account? Register”).

Set /login as the default route (redirect from / to /login).

Keep the routing setup clean and modular in App.jsx.

Design requirements:

Maintain consistent minimalistic styling across all pages.

Ensure page transitions are smooth (optional: add basic CSS fade-in).

Confirm form validations from previous step still work after routing integration.

YOU MUST NOT TAKE ANY ACTION FOR GIT OR GITHUB.
