Read the files AuthService.js and authController.js to fully understand the current signup implementation â€” including code style, structure, and comments. 

Then, using the same clean, modular, and well-documented approach, implement the following routes in the controller and service layers:

1. **Login**
   - Accept `email` and `password` in the request body.
   - Check if the user exists in the database.
   - Compare the provided password with the hashed password using bcrypt.
   - If credentials are valid, generate an auth token with `generateToken(user._id, res)`.
   - Return user details except password in the response.
   - Return `400` for invalid credentials, `500` for server errors.

2. **Logout**
   - Clear the `jwt` cookie by setting it to an empty string with `{ maxAge: 0 }`.
   - Return a success message on logout.
   - Handle and log any server errors.

3. **Get Profile**
   - Extract the user ID from the JWT token.
   - Fetch the user details from the database using the user ID.
   - Return the user object.
   - Handle and log errors, returning `500` for internal failures.

General Requirements:
- Maintain the same clean, readable style as the signup route.
- Use async/await with try/catch for error handling.
- Use proper HTTP status codes and descriptive JSON messages.
- Keep logic separated between services and controllers.
- Include meaningful comments explaining each key step.
