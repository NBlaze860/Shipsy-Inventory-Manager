# Design Decisions

## Backend Project Structure

**Context:** A clear and scalable backend project structure is needed to support the development of the Shipsy Inventory Manager. The structure should be modular and easy to navigate.

**Decision:** The project will follow a feature-based structure with a clear separation of concerns. The main directories are `src/config`, `src/models`, `src/services`, `src/controllers`, `src/routes`, `src/middleware`, and `src/utils`.

**Reasoning:** This structure promotes modularity and scalability. Each feature (e.g., authentication, products) has its own set of routes, controllers, and services, making it easy to develop and maintain individual features. The separation of concerns also improves code readability and reusability.

## API Endpoints

**Context:** A well-defined set of API endpoints is required to allow the frontend to interact with the backend services.

**Decision:** The API will be structured around three main resources: Authentication, Products, and Analytics. The endpoints are as follows:

*   **Authentication**
    *   `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
    *   `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.
    *   `GET /api/auth/profile`: Get the profile of the currently authenticated user.
*   **Products**
    *   `GET /api/products`: Get a list of all products.
    *   `GET /api/products/:id`: Get a single product by its ID.
    *   `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
    *   `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update an existing product.
    *   `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product.
*   **Analytics**
    *   `GET /api/analytics`: A placeholder endpoint for future analytics features.

**Reasoning:** This RESTful API design is intuitive and follows standard conventions. It provides a clear and consistent way for client applications to interact with the backend. The separation of resources makes the API easy to understand and extend.
