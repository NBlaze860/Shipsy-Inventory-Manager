        Update the /docs/DESIGN.md file for this project based on the changes we just discussed. 
        Follow these rules:
        - Keep the writing concise but professional.
        - Use clear section headings for each decision.
        - For every design choice, include: Context, Decision, and Reasoning.
        - If this change modifies or replaces a previous decision, clearly note it.
        - Maintain an organized, logical flow so that someone reading DESIGN.md alone can understand why each major decision was made.

        Update the /docs/ARCHITECTURE.md file to reflect the latest changes in code or system design from this session. 
        Follow these rules:
        - Keep it simple and clean, using markdown headings.
        - If changes affect the database, update the schema tables accordingly.
        - If changes affect classes or modules, update the class/module breakdown with concise descriptions of their roles.
        - If changes affect the overall system, update the technical documentation and flow diagrams/text to match.
        - Ensure the document remains logically structured and self-explanatory for someone seeing it for the first time.

        Update the /docs/AI_USAGE.md file for this project based on the AI interaction we just had. 
        Follow these rules:
        - Add a new numbered entry with the date and time.
        - Include: Context, Exact Prompt, AI Output Summary, Applied Changes, Reasoning, Verification method, and Related Commit.
        - Keep each entry self-contained so it can be understood without other context.
        - Ensure the language is professional but clear for both technical and non-technical readers.
        ```

2.  **Date:** 2025-08-14 06:38 PM
    *   **Context:** The user wanted to populate the route and controller files with placeholder implementations for the API endpoints.
    *   **Exact Prompt:**
        ```
        Fill in each route file using Express Router, mapping them to the correct controller functions as follows:

        Authentication Endpoints (routes/auth.js)
        - POST /api/auth/register → registerUser
        - POST /api/auth/login → loginUser
        - GET /api/auth/profile → getUserProfile

        Product Endpoints (routes/products.js)
        - GET /api/products → getProducts
        - GET /api/products/:id → getProductById
        - POST /api/products → createProduct
        - PUT /api/products/:id → updateProduct
        - DELETE /api/products/:id → deleteProduct

        Analytics Endpoints (routes/analytics.js)
        - Leave empty except for a placeholder GET route and explanatory comment.

        In each controller file, export functions for the above routes with placeholder implementations:
        Example:
        ```js

        export const registerUser = (req, res) => {
          // Register a new user
        };
        ```
    *   **AI Output Summary:** The AI successfully populated the route and controller files with the specified placeholder code and updated the `DESIGN.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` files to reflect the new API endpoints.
    *   **Applied Changes:**
        *   `backend/src/routes/auth.js`
        *   `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`
        *   `backend/src/routes/products.js`
        *   `backend/src/controllers/productController.js`
        *   `backend/src/routes/analytics.js`
        *   `backend/src/controllers/analyticsController.js`
        *   `docs/DESIGN.md`
        *   `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
    *   **Reasoning:** The user is building the backend API and needed the basic structure for the routes and controllers to be in place.
    *   **Verification method:** The user can inspect the created files to ensure they contain the correct placeholder code.
