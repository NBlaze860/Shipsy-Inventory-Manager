    - **Context:** The user wanted to populate the route and controller files with placeholder implementations for the API endpoints.
    - **Exact Prompt:**

      ````
      Fill in each route file using Express Router, mapping them to the correct controller functions as follows:

      Authentication Endpoints (routes/auth.js)
      - POST /api/auth/register → registerUser
      - POST /api/auth/login → loginUser
      - GET /api/auth/profile → getUserProfile

      Product Endpoints (routes/products.js)
      - GET /api/products → getProducts
      - GET /api/products/:id → getProductById
      - POST /api/products → createProduct
      - PUT /api/products/:id → updateProduct
      - DELETE /api/products/:id → deleteProduct

      Analytics Endpoints (routes/analytics.js)
      - Leave empty except for a placeholder GET route and explanatory comment.

      In each controller file, export functions for the above routes with placeholder implementations:
      Example:
      ```js

      export const registerUser = (req, res) => {
        // Register a new user
      };
      ````

    - **AI Output Summary:** The AI successfully populated the route and controller files with the specified placeholder code and updated the `DESIGN.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` files to reflect the new API endpoints.

3.  **Date:** 2025-08-14 07:15 PM

    - **Context:** The user requested the creation of Mongoose model files for User and Product entities with specific schema requirements, validation rules, and business logic.
    - **Exact Prompt:**

      ```
      Create two Mongoose model files in the `models` folder (folder already exists).
      Keep the code simple, clean, and professional, with self-explanatory comments.

      1. **User Model** (`models/User.js`):
      {
        _id: ObjectId,
        username: String (unique, required),
        email: String (unique, required),
        password: String (hashed),
        role: Enum ['admin', 'user'],
        createdAt: Date
      }

      2. **Product Model** (`models/Product.js`):
      {
        _id: ObjectId,
        name: String (required), // Text field
        description: String,
        category: Enum ['electronics', 'clothing', 'food', 'books', 'other'], // Enum field
        quantity: Number (required),
        unitPrice: Number (required),
        isActive: Boolean (default: true), // Boolean field
        totalValue: Number (calculated: quantity * unitPrice), // Calculated field
        createdBy: ObjectId (ref: User),
        createdAt: Date,
        updatedAt: Date
      }

      **Requirements:**
      - Use Mongoose syntax.
      - Add appropriate validation and schema options (`timestamps` where relevant).
      - Include a pre-save middleware in the Product model to calculate `totalValue`.
      - Export each model with `module.exports`.
      - Write concise, clear, and professional comments above fields and middleware explaining their purpose.
      ```

    - **AI Output Summary:** The AI successfully created two simplified Mongoose model files with clean, minimal validation and ES6 syntax. The User model includes essential authentication fields with role-based access control, while the Product model features automatic value calculations through pre-save middleware.

ate:** 2025-08-15 02:45 PM

    - **Context:** The user wanted to create a new backend route for an AI-powered product chatbot that uses Gemini LLM to answer product-related queries for authenticated users.
    - **Exact Prompt:**

      ```
      Create a new backend route in the "analytics" module for a simple product-related chatbot.

      Requirements:
      1. Route: POST /analytics/chatbot
      2. Input: JSON body with a field "prompt" (string).
      3. Authentication: Use the existing auth middleware to identify the current logged-in user.
      4. Behavior:
         - Use Gemini as the LLM.
         - Respond ONLY to queries related to the current authenticated user's products.
         - Fetch product data from the database filtered by the current user's ID.
         - If the prompt is not product-related, respond with a short message: "Not related to products."
         - Reply concisely — minimal words, only as much as needed to answer.
      5. Implementation:
         - Extract the authenticated user ID from the request.
         - Get all products belonging to the user.
         - Pass both the prompt and the product list as context to Gemini.
         - Return Gemini's response in JSON { "reply": "..." }.
      6. Code style: Match the existing project conventions, async/await style, and proper error handling.
      ```

    - **AI Output Summary:** The AI successfully implemented the chatbot functionality by creating a new POST endpoint at `/analytics/chatbot` with proper authentication, user-specific product filtering, and Gemini LLM integration. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and follows existing project conventions.
