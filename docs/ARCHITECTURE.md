# Architecture

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Layers

- **Routes (`src/routes`):** Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the corresponding controllers.
  - `auth.js`: Handles authentication-related routes (`/api/auth`).
  - `products.js`: Handles product-related routes (`/api/products`).
  - `analytics.js`: Handles analytics-related routes (`/api/analytics`) including the AI chatbot endpoint for product queries.
- **Controllers (`src/controllers`):** Handles incoming requests, validates the data, and calls the appropriate services to perform business logic.
  - `authController.js`: Contains the logic for user registration, login, logout, and profile retrieval.
  - `productController.js`: Contains the logic for CRUD operations on products, ensuring that users can only access their own products by passing the authenticated user's ID to the service layer and handling ownership validation.
  - `analyticsController.js`: Contains analytics logic including AI-powered chatbot functionality for product queries using Gemini LLM with authentication and user-specific product filtering.
- **Services (`src/services`):** Contains the core business logic of the application. It interacts with the models to access and manipulate data.
  - `AuthService.js`: Handles the business logic for user signup, login, logout, and profile retrieval.
  - `ProductService.js`: Implements the business logic for all CRUD operations on products, filtering products based on the `userId` to ensure data privacy.
  - `AnalyticsService.js`: A placeholder for future analytics-related business logic.
  - `GeminiService.js`: Handles AI-powered natural language processing for product queries using Google's Gemini LLM, with built-in query validation and context construction.
- **Models (`src/models`):** Defines the database schemas and provides an interface to interact with the database.
  - `User.js`: User authentication and authorization model with role-based access control.
  - `Product.js`: Product inventory model with automatic value calculations and user references.
- **Middleware (`src/middleware`):** Provides a way to execute code before a request is handled by the controllers. This is used for tasks such as authentication, validation, and error handling.
- **Config (`src/config`):** Contains configuration files for the database, JWT, and other services.
- **Utils (`src/utils`):** Contains utility functions that can be used throughout the application.

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is structured to support a scalable and maintainable React application, with a clear separation of concerns.

### Directory Structure

- **`src/components`**: Contains reusable components that are used across different parts of the application.
  - `ui/`: Basic, general-purpose UI elements like buttons, inputs, and modals.
  - `layout/`: Components that define the overall structure of the application, such as headers, footers, and sidebars.
  - `auth/`, `products/`, `analytics/`: Feature-specific components related to authentication, products, and analytics.
- **`src/pages`**: Contains top-level components that represent the different pages of the application (e.g., `Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`). Each page component is responsible for composing the layout and components for a specific route.
- **`src/store`**: Holds all the Redux-related code for state management.
  - `index.js`: The main Redux store configuration.
  - `*Slice.js`: Redux Toolkit slices that define the state, reducers, and actions for different features (e.g., `authSlice.js`, `productsSlice.js`).
- **`src/utils`**: A collection of helper functions and utilities that can be used throughout the application.
- **`src/styles`**: Contains global CSS files and styling-related configurations.

### Routing

The frontend routing is managed by `react-router-dom`. The main application routes are defined in `App.jsx`:
- `/login`: The default route, which renders the `Login` component.
- `/register`: Renders the `Register` component.
- `/dashboard`: Renders the `Dashboard` component.
- `/`: Redirects to `/login`.
